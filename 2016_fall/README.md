In addition, on December 19, 2016, Daina Bouquin planned and ran a [Holiday CryptoParty for the broader Harvard Community](https://cfa-library.github.io/Collaborations/CryptoParty/). This was a collaborative event with many other groups both within and external to Harvard. More on Wolbach collaborations can be found in the [CfA-Library Collaborations Repo](https://github.com/CfA-Library/Collaborations).
